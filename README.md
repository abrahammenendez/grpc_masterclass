**What is this?**

Some quick-and-dirty gRPC clients/servers I coded for Stephane Maarek's course [gRPC Master Class: Build Modern API & Micro services](https://www.udemy.com/course/grpc-java/).

There are even some printStackTrace(), but I just wanted to learn gRPC and it definitely got the job done.

**What did I learn?**

- Inner workings of gRPC
- Differences between REST and gRPC, HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
- How to code Unary, Server Streaming, Client Streaming & Bi-Directional Streaming API servers/clients in Java using the Gradle gRPC plugin
- Advanced gRPC concepts such as Error Handling, Deadlines & SSL Security

**How was the course?**

I learned a lot, but Stephane spends way too much time doing kind of the same exercises over and over again. Don't feel bad if you want to skip some content, just make sure that you understand what you are doing.
